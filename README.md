# EE 340 - Communications Labs

## Overview
This repository contains all the files, submissions, and handouts related to the EE 340 Communications Laboratory course at IIT Bombay. The course focuses on practical applications of communication systems, utilizing GNU Radio for Software Defined Radio (SDR) design and implementation.

## Course Description
EE 340 supplements the EE-308 introductory course to communication systems. Students will engage in hands-on experiments with various modulation techniques and signal-processing tasks.

## Lab Overview
The course consists of the following labs:

1. **Lab 1:** Getting Familiarized with GNU Radio
2. **Lab 2:** Implementation of AM in GNU Radio
3. **Lab 1 Hardware:** AM Modulator and AM Demodulator
4. **Lab 3:** FM Modulation and Demodulation
5. **Lab 4:** Non-linearity and its effects in communication systems
6. **Lab 2 Hardware:** Match filtering in Digital Modulation and Implementation of QPSK Modulation Scheme
7. **Lab 5:** Pulse shaping and end to end digital data transmission over ideal channel
8. **Lab 3 Hardware:** Generation of modulated RF signals using the “IQ-Modulator Board“ and Jamming
9. **Lab 6:** Match filtering in Digital Modulation and Implementation of QPSK Modulation Scheme
10. **Lab 7:** Multipath Propagation and Equalization
11. **Lab 8:** Carrier Frequency and Phase Synchronisation in Communication Links
